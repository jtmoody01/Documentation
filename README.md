## Contributing to Misty's Documentation

This documentation is early stage and is growing continuously. We're grateful for all feedback and contributions. 

### Found something small that you think should be changed? 

[Create an issue](https://github.com/MistyCommunity/Documentation/issues) right here in the repo!

### Want to contribute something bigger than a bug report? 

First, before you invest too much time, reach out and let us know what you're thinking. It may be that we already know about the issue or are already creating new content. Reaching out could save you time and effort.

Second, assuming we're not already making the changes, go ahead and fork the repo. After editing the source files, build the documentation locally and make a pull request, as described [here](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-forks/).
